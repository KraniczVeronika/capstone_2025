## Overview
This repository supports my Business Data Analytics Project.  
It contains all relevant code and documentation related to the heart disease prediction project.

The repository is kept up to date: the latest version of the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) is continuously re-uploaded as work progresses and improvements are made.

## AI Usage
 ChatGPT (v4) and Colab Gemini, were used for:
- Brainstorming project structure and literature organization
- Debugging and optimizing Python code
- Ensuring best practices in model validation and evaluation
- Streamlining final code and improving documentation clarity

## Final Report
The official final report is uploaded separately on Moodle in Word (.docx) format.

**This work is submitted for academic assessment.**
